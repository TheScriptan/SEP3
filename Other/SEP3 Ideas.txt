Brainstorm:
	- Token for sorting student experience in a specific company
	- When assigning a shift, administrator can find students who worked in a specific company, sort the students by tokens and choose a student, later student gets the offer to his Offered Shift window in the Student Calendar
	- Shift would have the amount of students has been assigned to the shift + ArrayList of the students assigned to it
	- Request Shift -> Take shift, when student takes the shift it is instantly assigned to him, with no administrator confirmation
	- Administrator can assign a shift if the shift quanitity is maximum. Example Prime Cargo T3 5/5 Vikars -> assign a shift 6/6 vikars

Optional Features:
	- When there is a new available shift, students should get a notification to the email
